# Overall Solution Architecture 
This document provides an overview of the NPP pilot system's overall solution architecture.

## Hosting
While the phase 1 pilot system was hosted at Amazon&trade; AWS, the environment was relocated to the Google&trade; Cloud Platform (GCP) during phase 2. GCP is the cloud environment preferred by DfT.

## Availability
One might say: a pilot system is no critical infrstructure. However, with increasing number of pilot partners (operators, service providers), a good level of availability of the system is important. 


## Scalability
While scope and coverage of the pilot system are limited, it has been designed to be scalable moving forward.
