# Standard Location Codes
To date in the UK, cashless parking zone numbers have been allocated by providers when setting up contracts with operators.  This has created the potential for duplicate numbers across zones in different parts of the UK. 
With multi-vendor schemes being implemented in a number of areas it is a good opportunity to identify a co-ordinated approach to numbers that, whilst not requiring existing numbers to change, will ensure that numbers in multi-vendor areas are unique.   
These numbers will be allocated for specific locations by a recognised neutral agent (e.g. the public body to be set up to run the National Parking Platform) to any parking operator (public or private) that requests them, enabling any cashless parking zone to be uniquely identified.
