# Standard Location Codes
To date in the UK, cashless parking zone numbers have been allocated by providers when setting up contracts with operators.  This has created the potential for duplicate numbers across zones in different parts of the UK. 
The NPP is a good opportunity to create a co-ordinated approach to numbers that, whilst not requiring existing numbers to change, will ensure that numbers in multi-vendor areas are unique.   
These numbers will be allocated for specific locations by a recognised neutral agent (the public body set up to run the National Parking Platform) to any parking operator (public or private) that requests them, enabling any cashless parking zone to be uniquely identified.

Current zone codes are primarily 4 or 5 digits, (although some providers have allocated numbers with 6 digits). Using a 6-digit range offers the best chance for preventing overlaps with existing codes.  A 6-digit range is therefore proposed for the multi-vendor range with exclusions for number ranges already used by providers (these numbers will be included in the multi-vendor list where possible).  
A six digit range from 100000 to 999999 would effectively provide a million numbers â€“ which should be able to accommodate all existing and future UK-based solutions.
